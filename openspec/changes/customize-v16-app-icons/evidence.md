# Development icon acceptance — 2026-11-02

App `silent_print`: icon `/assets/silent_print/images/app-icon-v1.svg`.

- Existing corporate artwork was inspected for palette reuse. These original vector functional symbols form a coherent navy/cyan/amber family, with no embedded third-party logos, raster data, fonts or remote dependencies.
- Strict OpenSpec passed before implementation. The native logo contract and all thirteen public symlinks were independently reviewed before applying source changes.
- All thirteen SVGs passed XML/viewBox/size/safety checks. They were rendered by an existing local SVG renderer at 80 px and as a contact sheet; the rounded tile boundary and legibility were visually checked.
- Every asset returned HTTP 200 and image/svg+xml; response SHA256 matched its app-owned source. This app SHA256: `8840ee2d9f573b4bfca2a1c5a7a6004acebdb765e21563576551097f5f4bc12e`.
- Native app_data contains all thirteen expected logo URLs for Administrator, with destinations and nonempty Docks preserved. Guest still receives no usable routes or Docks. Permission-helper and Dock source hashes are unchanged.
- Each hook AST differs only by the intended logo key. Deployment inserted that key into the current live hook, preserving other source/WIP, and copied only the new SVG. No database metadata imports, builds, migrations, service restarts, role grants, external integration calls or business data changes occurred.
- The operator confirmed after refreshing: “sí, ya muestra los iconos”. This is actual development visual acceptance; the native/static checks did not create an authenticated HTTP session.
- The dedicated branch depends on the previously accepted navigation feature branch, not yet merged into version-16. Live checkout branches and maintenance refs remain unchanged. Production and official apps were not modified.
- No new site backups were made. Rollback uses only the recorded hook preimage/new image, preserving existing assets/navigation.

Commit/push identifiers are added after source delivery. Do not promote to production or merge maintenance branches implicitly.
